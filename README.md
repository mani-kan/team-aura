Title: Skill-Barter Network 
Problem Statement:
In educational institutions, many students and staff possess valuable skills, but there is no organized platform to share and utilize them effectively. Learners often struggle to find the right people to learn from, while skilled individuals lack motivation and recognition for teaching. Additionally, many students are unable to afford paid courses or training programs, which limits their skill development. This results in wasted potential and slower learning growth. 
The Skill Barter Network addresses these challenges by providing a single platform where users can exchange skills without money, connect easily, and earn ratings and badges, creating an affordable and collaborative learning environment.

1. Project Overview
Skill-Barter Network is a student-focused web application designed to enable users to learn new skills by exchanging knowledge instead of money. The platform allows students to connect, communicate, collaborate, and grow through peer learning and mentorship.
The system includes registration, skill management, messaging, request handling, video interaction, and security monitoring features within a clean, modern user interface.
